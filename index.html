<h5 align="left" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: medium">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. </h5>
<p> 
In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.

<i>HTML</i> elements are the building blocks of <i> HTML</i> pages. With <I>HTML</I> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<i>HTML</i> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.<i> HTML </i> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <-image> and <-input> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <-p> and <-/p> surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags.Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
</p>    
<h2>Header Tags</h2>
<p>
HTML provides different levels of headings using the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> tags.The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag is the highest level, while the <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> tag is the lowest level.They are used to structure the content of a webpage and represent different sections or sub-sections.
</p>
<h2>Bold, Italic, and Underline</h2>
<p>
You can apply different styles to your text using CSS. To make text bold, use the <span class="bold">bold</span> class. To make text italic, use the <span class="italic">italic</span> class.To underline text, use the <span class="underline">underline</span> class.
</p>
<h2>Setting Text Color</h2>
<p>
You can change the color of text using CSS.Use the <code>color</code> property and specify the color value. For example, the heading tags in this page are styled with different colors. You can choose any color using color names, hexadecimal codes, or RGB values.
